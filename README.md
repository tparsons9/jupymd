Enables Jupyter notebook functionality in Obsidian. Make markdown files behave like `.ipynb` notebooks, with live code execution, rich output rendering, and bidirectional syncing between `.md` and `.ipynb` files.

## Integrate your programming notes into Obsidian

With JupyMD you can:

- Run code in a variety of languages
- Create plots with `matplotlib`
- Conduct data analysis with `pandas` dataframes
- Build machine learning models with `sklearn` and `pytorch`
- And much of what you would typically use a Jupyter notebook for

... all in your Obsidian vault!

## Use-cases:

### Machine learning workflow

### Visualising fractals with `matplotlib`

## Features

JupyMD is designed to be a feature rich Jupyter notebook editor inside of Obsidian, similar to VSCode's Jupyter notebook functionality and Jupyter Lab. Some of its features include:

- **Multiple Programming Languages:** Built-in support for Python, Julia, R, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash, and Rust. Additional languages can also work through compatible Jupyter kernels. Supports external libraries.
- **Notebook Conversion**
    - Convert existing notes in Obsidian to Jupyter notebooks
    - Convert existing Jupyter notebooks to Markdown notes
- **Bidirectional Updates:** Changes in Obsidian or Jupyter automatically sync between `.md` and `.ipynb` files
- **Execute Code:** Run code blocks in Obsidian with output captured below each block, regardless of viewing mode
- **Persistent Execution Environment:** Variables and imports defined in one code block are remembered by the following code blocks
- **True Jupyter Sync:** Executed code blocks automatically update output metadata in linked `.ipynb` file
- **Persistent Output Rendering:** Executed code outputs stay visible after restart and sync to `.ipynb` file
- **Rich Output:** Support for image and dataframe outputs, magic commands

## Prerequisites

Python is necessary as a tooling environment to invoke Jupytext and Jupyter Client, even if you don't plan to use Python in a Jupyter notebook.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The following dependencies can be installed natively through the plugin settings on your set tooling environment:

- [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)
- [Jupyter Client](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client)

JupyMD natively prompts an installation for [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/) when a Python interpreter is selected. For further language support, you will need to manually install [Jupyter kernels listed here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) along with your programming language of choice. Installed Jupyter kernels are automatically detected by JupyMD.

### Using other programming languages

JupyMD runs code through the standard Jupyter kernel protocol, allowing it to discover kernels beyond its built-in languages. To add another language, install its runtime and a compatible Jupyter kernel, then reload JupyMD and select the kernel for your notebook.

When JupyMD starts, it registers interactive code blocks for Python, Julia, R, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash, and Rust. It also reads the language reported by every detected Jupyter kernel and registers a matching JupyMD code block automatically. For example, a kernel reporting `c++` will cause ` ```c++ ` blocks to receive JupyMD’s execution controls.

Compatibility depends on how the kernel identifies its language. The code fence must match the language reported by the kernel, and Jupytext must recognize it as a code cell. Some kernels use different identifiers such as `C++17` and `c++`, which may require adjusting the kernelspec or code fence.

Languages without built in support may not include syntax highlighting, aliases, friendly runtime details, or the same level of integration and testing as the languages listed above.

To display a block using Obsidian’s standard code-block renderer instead of JupyMD’s interactive renderer, capitalize its language identifier, for example, use ` ```Python ` instead of ` ```python `.

## Getting started

Download the plugin through the [Obsidian community plugin browser](obsidian://show-plugin?id=jupymd) and enable it.

To set up JupyMD, configure a Python tooling environment from the settings. This will list Python installations in your system for selection. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for a tooling environment. This can be set up easily through the set up modal in the settings.

### To convert a note to a Jupyter notebook

You can transform your note into a Jupyter notebook in two ways:

- Pressing "run cell" on a code block
- Running the `JupyMD: Create notebook from note` command

This will:

- Prompt you to select a Jupyter kernel for the Juypter notebook
- Create an `.ipynb` file with the same file name as the current note on the file directory
- Continuously sync the contents of the markdown file to the `.ipynb` file

You may choose to ignore the created `.ipynb` file completely, as its functionality will be mirrored in Obsidian.

### To convert a Jupyter notebook to a note

Move your Jupyter notebook to your vault. Executing the following command will list out all `.ipynb` files within your vault which you can select to convert into a note:

> `JupyMD: Create note from Jupyter notebook`

This will create a Markdown note (`.md`) with the same file name as the notebook in the same directory where the Jupyter notebook is.

## Local access and security

JupyMD is a desktop-only plugin because local Jupyter integration requires capabilities beyond the Obsidian vault API. The plugin uses them for the following limited purposes:

- **Process execution:** JupyMD starts the selected Python tooling environment, Jupytext, Jupyter kernels, and a user-configured external notebook editor. Commands are launched directly with argument arrays rather than evaluated through a command shell. Package installation runs only after explicit user confirmation.
- **Filesystem access:** JupyMD reads and writes paired `.ipynb` files, stores plugin-managed kernelspecs below the vault configuration directory, detects virtual environments in the vault root, and discovers installed interpreters and kernels in their standard system locations (including pyenv directories).
- **Vault file listing:** The "Create note from Jupyter notebook" command lists `.ipynb` files so the user can select one to convert. JupyMD does not enumerate the vault during normal code execution.
- **Clipboard writes:** Holding Shift while clicking the kernel status copies the selected interpreter or kernel executable path. JupyMD does not read the clipboard.

Code executed in a notebook has the same operating-system permissions as Obsidian. Only run notebooks and select kernels that you trust.

JupyMD does not include telemetry and does not make its own network requests. If the user confirms a package installation, the selected package manager may contact its configured package indexes.
